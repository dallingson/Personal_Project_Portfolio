# Example Project

## Overview
This project is one from my Dynamic Web Development Class. The plan was to create a website that had dynamic elements that allowed the user to navigate between pages, filter through products, add items to a cart, and purchase said items. This website is a mock up of a website for a baking business. It includes a variety of products the user can add to a cart. The cart can then be opened and items can be adjusted as the user sees fit. They can then 'purchase' these items.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features
- Responsive design
- Accessibility
- Dynamic Web Elements

## Future Improvements
- Add functionality to process an actual payment (If the website were to be used for the business)
