# Example Project

## Overview
This project is to show off what I have learned about the Godot Game Engine. I made a simple video game with simple physics like gravity, jumping, etc. I used it to create a video game demo of a grandpa that fights squirrels.

## Technologies Used
- GDscript
- ChatGPT

## Challenges & Solutions
I haven't ever used Godot, so I had to learn how to use an entire new system including programming physics, animations, etc. 
I watched a few tutorials on how to do most of these things while also utilizing Artificial Intelligence tools to help me.

## Features
- Godot
- Easy to learn
- Simple design

## Future Improvements
- Make a full level
- Implement more animations
- Make a story
- Create a full video game.
